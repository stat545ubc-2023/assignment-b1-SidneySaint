### Welcome to the page for my R function creation and documentation. This is a project assigned by STAT 545B, wherein students are asked to create, document, and test their own R function.

### This repository structure is as follows. All files document my first-ever R function (for summarizing numeric data by groups/clusters), named 'SumByCluster'

### assignment-b1-SidneySaint/
  1. SumByCluster.Rmd: The Rstudio markdown file containing the code I used to write, exemplify, document, and tag my function. You can download this file and run it in R studio on your local device to follow my steps. 
  2. SumByCluster.md: :sparkles: The knitted RStudio markdown file, containing the code in the *Rmd version of this file and its output as a github document. Open it on github to see my code and it's output.
  3. SumByCluster.Rd: An .Rd file generated by R package 'roxygen2', containing some information about use of my function (more relevant when/if I introduced my function to an R packaage).
