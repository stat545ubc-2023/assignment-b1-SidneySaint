\title{Summarize numeric variables in long format data for each level of a grouping variable}
\usage{
SumByCluster(df, id)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame (intended for use on a tibble, table or frame in long format) containing a grouping variable. I named this df for simplicity (because the input is a data frame and this is a commonly-used abbreviation).}

\item{id}{A column in df (your data frame); your desired grouping variable (for example, participant ID in repeated measures data). I named this 'id' because when I wrote the function I had in mind a grouping variable / cluster variable of participant id / person who has more than one measurement point  (although this is not required nor is participant id the grouping variable used in the examples).}
}
\value{
Nothing; a data table (containing descriptive statistics for the numeric variables in the original data frame, grouped by the specified cluster variable) is produced when users store the output of the applied function (with '<-') (example 'dfnew <- SumByCluster(df, id)'. Follow with 'View(dfnew)')
}
\description{
This function is meant principally to summarize / produce descriptive statistics (e.g., the mean, standard deviation, minimum, etc.) of numeric variables in a data frame (df), across each unique level of a specified grouping / cluster variable (id). For example, if the input data set (df) came from a repeated measures design wherein the same 8 participants took maths, science, and English tests on 4 different occasions, you could apply this function to describe each participants' scores on each test across all 4 testing occasions (for easy comparison of, for example, Jamie's mean math score to Sandy's mean math score). In the example provided, the grouping /cluster variable (id) would be participant.
